# The Murder Mystery Resource Pack
This resource pack contains additional things that are used in Dud3's murder mystery map, and while not required, are recommended to have. The main goal of this pack is to add additional cosmetic stuff without overwriting any base game textures or sounds.

As of right now, this pack contains:
- Knife skins
- Gun skins
- ~~Hats~~ This is currently impossible because armor doesn't support CustomModelData and block models are a pain to work with. Blame Mojang.
- Custom death sounds
- Various other sound effects
- Music
- Other graphics and icons mostly used by kit items

Just about all of the textures for skins and such were pulled from [Itembound: Rebound](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/itembound-fixed/), go check it out if you ever get the chance.

## Knife Skins
- Default (Just an Iron Sword, what do you expect?)
- Master Sword
- 1000 Degree Knife
- Brick
- Buster Sword
- Twig
- Microphone
- Crying Obsidian Sword
- Magma Sword
- Scissors (Red)
- Lightsaber (Red)
- Dagger (underhand knife)
- Crucible (Doom Eternal)
- Bloody Knife
- Chainsaw (Netherite)
- Stop Sign
- Spoon
- Bonk Hammer
- Reaper Scythe
- Iron Bat
- Rainbow Sword
- Bus Stop Sign
- Giant Rock Candy
- Budget Masamune
- Rapier (Diamond)
- Pencil (Yellow)

## Gun Skins
- Default (The standard Bow. Again, what are you expecting here?)
- Rain-bow
- Candy Cannon
- Compound Bow
- Water Gun (Green)
- Blaze Bow

These pale in comparison to the knife skins because bows are a bit harder to get working with CustomModelData, and due to a general lack of bow textures.

## Kit/misc stuff
- The Radar Scan, Heartbeat Sensor, Datapad and Phone all have their own graphics to distinguish them easier when players are holding them.
- Murderer Ghost also has a graphic for it.

## Death Sounds/Music
- Bonk (plays when killing someone with the Bonk Hammer)
- Boo-womp
- Mario Kart Double Dash

- Super Mario Galaxy
- Super Mario Sunshine
- Super Mario World
- Snake (Metal Gear Solid)
- Steel Sting
- ~~sus~~ Among Us
- Undertale/Deltarune

## Music
- Bowser's Theme (Super Mario 64)
- Crazy Cap Shop
- The Only Thing They Fear is You
- Endless Stairs (Super Mario 64)
- Mio Honda - Step!
